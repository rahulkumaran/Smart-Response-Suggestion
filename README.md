# Smart-Response-Suggestion

A lot of email providers and social networking sites like Gmail and LinkedIn have a smart response generator. Depending on the message one receives, the algorithm suggests 3 possible replies to that message.<br>
Usually these are done using RNNs and LSTMs. <br>
This repository contains the code for the paper written by Googlers on Smart Reply.<br>

The paper can be checked out <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.04870.pdf">here</a>.<br>

I'll be looking at making this into a full fledged system in the coming days, but until then, I believe that this is a good start!
